# User Guide

*This section is made to be consulted by any user.*

## Additional Features

### Themes

You can switch between **light** and **dark** theme by clicking on the ðŸ”† icon in the upper-left corner of the interface.

### Predefined details

You can change the content of predefined details (*Single Player, Multiplayer,* etc.) by editing the ``details.txt``.
> You can have **up to 9** predefined details.

##  Troubleshooting

### General solutions

The following steps can avoid/solve common problems regarding the overall functionality of the application:

+ Go to the ``.zip`` file you downloaded containing the application, right-click on it and go to ``Properties``, check the ``Unblock`` box and click on the **apply** button, extract the application again and then, if possible, run it as **administrator**. This can solve problems regarding permissions.

+ Avoid storing the application and its files in directories with special characters in their names (E.g.: ``Ã¢,Ã‘,Ã§,&.``). If you are still having trouble when starting the application, try moving it to the main drive, usually ``C\``.

+ If the application seems to go into infinite loads or is unable to connnect to the internet, it is likely that your system may be preventing the application from using certain features over the network, check your antivirus and firewall settings.

### Specific solutions

â€¢ **The application is open on the taskbar, but the window does not appear.**
> Right click on the Rich Presence U icon visible in the taskbar and then select **maximize**, the window should appear on your main display again.

â€¢ **I updated Rich Presence U, but the app is crashing when I try to start it.**
> Close the application, open you file explorer, in the address bar type: ``%localappdata%\RPC_U``, go to this directory and delete all existing files, then open Rich Presence U again. 

# Developer Guide

*This section is made specifically for developers and people who are interested in modifying the application.*

- *GameMaker Studio 2 - Runtime v23.1.1.212*.
	1. Download the repository.
	2. Open ``/Project/RPC_U.yyp`` as a project.
	3. Go into **Build** > **Create Executable**.

>  For information on how rich presence works and how to use its features, see the official [documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to) provided by Discord.

## Overrides

### Client redirection

You can replace any platform in Rich Presence U to use your own custom icons and titles without the need of compiling the source code again. The following example will demonstrate how to replace the Wii U client.

1. Set up your files.

	The **directory** for the platform that you are replacing must be structured in this way:
	```
	client.ini			The client database.
	fc.png				Icon for friend code tooltip.
	000.png				1st title's icon.
	001.png				2nd title's icon.
	002.png				3rd title's icon.
	...png				Etc...
	```

	And the **database file** (``client.ini``) must be structured in this way:
	```ini
	[CLIENT_0]

	ID = "012345678987654321"		# Client id of your Discord application.

	T_000 = "%CUSTOM%"			# 1st title's entry, this one is a special parameter.
	T_001 = "Super Brothers. 256"		# 2nd title's entry.
	T_002 = "The Game: Remastered DX"	# 3rd title's entry.
	T_... = "..."				# Etc...
	```
	> **Note:** If you keep the ``%CUSTOM%`` parameter it will force the details bar to be used as a title, but it can be set to a predefined title like any other entry

	Here's the [default directory](https://github.com/ninstar/Rich-Presence-U/tree/master/Assets/WiiU) with the default icons and database file for the Wii U client, you can use it as a template.

2. Upload your files into a host or repository, preferably one that anyone can have permission to download files from (if you are planning to share this modification with other people).

3. Go to [https://discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/), create a new application (if you don't have one), go to rich presence tab and upload all your icons there (incluinding ``fc.png``) following the exact same numbered file names as the files in your host.

4. Copy the **client id** of your Discord application, go back to 
``client.ini`` and paste it in the ``ID`` field.

5. Create a new file named ``NETWORK.cfg`` in the same directory as the application with the following content:
	```ini
	[URLS]
	wiiu = "X"
	```
	> **X** is where the URL of the directory containing the icons and the database file in your host goes.

6. Open Rich Presence U and select the platform that you replaced with custom redirection.
