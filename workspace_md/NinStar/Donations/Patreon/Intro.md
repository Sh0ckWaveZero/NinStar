Hi! Thanks for visiting my Patreon page, below you will find a brief summary of what I do on the internet and contact information.

## As a designer and content creator

My main job is as a designer, which usually involve GUIs, web design and logos; I also have a passion for pixel art, you can see some in my game projects, but I also do others things:

> [**Blog**](https://ninstarts.blogspot.com/) - Here you can find the official pages for my projects (always updated) and posts related to my content in general.

> [**Main Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/ninstaryt) - Mainly focused on showcasing my own projects, fan creations and events (usually level design contests).

> [**Stream Channel**](https://twitch.tv/ninstartv) - Mainly focused on gameplays, there is no specific time for me to start a stream, but I usually do it on weekends when I have free time. You can find a list of the games that I play more often in the description of the channel, but sometimes I can end up playing something completely random.

I also upload my content on the following websites:
+ [**Tumblr** (Miniblog)](https://ninstars.tumblr.com) - A place where I post about games I've been playing.
+ [**YouTube** (2nd Channel)](https://www.youtube.com/ninstardirectorscut) - Highlights, previews and stream archive.
+ [**Pixiv**](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=14066796)  - Sketches and arts. 
+ [**Soundcloud**](https://soundcloud.com/ninstarsc) - Covers and songs.
+ [**GameBanana**](https://gamebanana.com/members/1650200) - Modding in general.

## As a developer

I have been creating applications and games since I was 14, some of the most popular being [UniMaker](https://github.com/ninstar/UniMaker) and [Ninty Launcher](https://github.com/ninstar/Ninty-Launcher).
