### Thank you for supporting me!

If you are a member of my [**Discord**](https://invite.gg/ninstar) you will automatically receive access to the chats mentioned in your tier, if you don't, you can contact me directly: ``NinStar#8700``

> **Don't forget:** The access to the chat for selected members is a permanent reward, I will not remove your role even after your period as a patron ends. âœ¨

But if you don't have Discord and you still want to contact me, you can do this through one of the following links:

+ **Twitter** - [@NinStarTT](https://twitter.com/ninstartt)
+ **Mail** - [ninstarm@outlook.com](mailto:ninstarm@outlook.com) | This is **my personal** email, the best way to contact me.

I will try to answer as soon as possible in all cases.
