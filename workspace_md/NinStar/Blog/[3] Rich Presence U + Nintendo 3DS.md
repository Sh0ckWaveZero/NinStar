A new update for [**Rich Presence U**](https://ninstars.blogspot.com/p/rich-presence-u.html) is available, this time supporting ***Nintendo 3DS*** games!

Initially there are a total of 113 titles for *Nintendo 3DS*, I will include more soon.

I also made some other changes to the application:

- Now all icons are loaded dynamically over the internet, this means that the application is now much smaller and you will no longer need to update it just to receive the latest game list. 

- Automatic notifications when a new version of the application is available.

See ``changelog.txt`` for more details.
