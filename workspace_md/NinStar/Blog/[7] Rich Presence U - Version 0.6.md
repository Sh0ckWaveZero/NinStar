**Rich Presence U v0.6** is here, featuring a brand new interface.

It is considerably smaller compared to the previous one and now it is possible to resize it to any size, not to mention it has a dark theme ðŸŒš

I did this mainly with UX improvements in mind, buttons and options are more responsive and easier to understand.

But if you still prefer the old interface, you can continue using **v0.5**, I didn't made any functional changes to the database since the last release, for now it will work normally. ~~*just for now*...~~

Also, for those who are interested in the source code part, I translated all code comments into English, I hope this make things easier.
